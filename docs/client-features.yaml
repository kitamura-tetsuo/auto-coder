## GraphRAG MCP Server (Customized Fork)

Since auto-coder v2025.10.23, a customized GraphRAG MCP server is bundled with the package. This fork of [rileylemm/graphrag_mcp](https://github.com/rileylemm/graphrag_mcp) has been specialized for code analysis.

### Location

- **Source**: mcp/graphrag_mcp/
- **Documentation**: `docs/BUNDLED_MCP_SERVER.md`
- **Fork Info**: `src/auto_coder/mcp_servers/graphrag_mcp/FORK_INFO.md`

### Purpose

This fork provides specialized TypeScript/JavaScript code analysis capabilities using TypeScript code structure indexed by ts-morph, replacing the original documentation search functionality.

### Key Modifications from Original

1. **Specialized for Code Analysis**: Changed from generic documentation search to TypeScript/JavaScript code structure analysis
2. **Custom Graph Schema**: Adapted to work with ts-morph generated graph structure with node types like `File`, `Function`, `Method`, `Class`, `Interface`, and relationship types like `CONTAINS`, `CALLS`, `EXTENDS`, `IMPLEMENTS`, `IMPORTS`
3. **Code-Specific Tools**: Replaced original `search_documentation` and `hybrid_search` with code analysis tools

### Available Tools

The following code analysis tools are available through the MCP server:

#### find_symbol
Find code symbols by fully qualified name in the codebase.

#### get_call_graph
Analyze function/method call relationships to understand code flow.

#### get_dependencies
Analyze file dependencies to understand project structure.

#### impact_analysis
Analyze change impact across the codebase to understand how a change might affect other parts of the system.

#### semantic_code_search
Search for code using semantic understanding rather than just text matching.

### Setup

The MCP server is automatically set up when running:

```bash
auto-coder graphrag setup-mcp
```

This command copies the bundled server from `src/auto_coder/mcp_servers/graphrag_mcp/` to `~/graphrag_mcp/` and starts the Docker container.

### Usage

After setup, the tools can be accessed through the auto-coder CLI when the MCP server is running.
